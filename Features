Feature List with Prerequisites in Order

To successfully build and deploy the AI platform with an Infrastructure AI Agent powered by tokens, follow this ordered list of features, ensuring all prerequisites are met before moving to the next step:


---

1. Avalanche Blockchain Setup

Prerequisites:

Install Avalanche CLI (Installation Guide).

Set up a wallet for development (e.g., MetaMask).


Features:

Create a Custom Token:

Name: InfrastructureToken (INFRA)

Use Avalanche CLI:

avalanche-cli create token \
  --name InfrastructureToken \
  --symbol INFRA \
  --initial-supply 1000000 \
  --decimals 18


Deploy Smart Contracts:

Task management: Record user tasks, results, and token payments.

Token payment validation: Deduct tokens for service usage.




---

2. Backend Development

Prerequisites:

Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js installed.

Web3 libraries for blockchain interaction.

Avalanche token and smart contract addresses.


Features:

Blockchain Interaction:

Fetch user token balances.

Record task metadata (e.g., file hash, commands, results).


Task Submission API:

Accept user requests (e.g., file uploads, command executions).

Validate token payments before processing.


AI Integration:

Connect to Aider AI (Ollama LLM) for real-time feedback.




---

3. AI Infrastructure Agent

Prerequisites:

Install AI libraries (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Ollama).

Connect the backend to cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS).


Features:

AI Feedback:

Analyze task results (e.g., deployment logs, PowerShell outputs).

Provide optimizations and insights.


Automation:

Execute infrastructure tasks (e.g., IaC deployments, Azure ARM templates).

Automate PowerShell command execution.




---

4. Cloud and IaC Integration

Prerequisites:

Access to Azure or other cloud platforms.

Set up API keys or service principals for automation.

Familiarity with IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, ARM, Bicep).


Features:

IaC Deployment:

Parse and deploy IaC files submitted by users.

Automate resource creation and scaling.


Cloud Resource Management:

Provision resources via API (e.g., Azure Resource Manager).




---

5. Frontend Development

Prerequisites:

Install React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.

Basic understanding of wallet integration (e.g., MetaMask).


Features:

User Dashboard:

Task submission interface (e.g., file uploads, command input).

Token balance display and transaction history.

Feedback/results viewer for completed tasks.


Wallet Integration:

Connect user wallets for token payments (MetaMask or similar).

Display real-time token balances.




---

6. Token Payment Workflow

Prerequisites:

Fully deployed smart contracts for task and payment management.

Integrated Web3 libraries in the backend.


Features:

Payment Processing:

Deduct tokens for submitted tasks.

Validate payments on the blockchain before task execution.


Task Metadata Logging:

Log each taskâ€™s status, user ID, payment, and results on the blockchain.




---

7. Deployment and Scaling

Prerequisites:

Set up a cloud hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Azure).

Configure CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).


Features:

Platform Deployment:

Deploy backend (e.g., FastAPI/Node.js) and frontend on cloud hosting.

Scale infrastructure to handle multiple users.


Monitoring:

Use tools like Prometheus/Grafana for platform health monitoring.




---

8. Testing and Optimization

Prerequisites:

Fully deployed platform components.


Features:

Smart Contract Testing:

Ensure tasks and payments are logged correctly on the blockchain.


AI Feedback Validation:

Test AIâ€™s ability to analyze and optimize task results.


Load Testing:

Simulate concurrent user tasks to validate platform scalability.
